    </header>

<!-- Introductory Section -->
<section class="intro">
    <p>Welcome to my final project for PP434: Automated Data Visualisation for Policymaking. Here, I’ve explored greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trends and their implications for policymaking. Through data-driven visualizations, this project aims to uncover insights that bridge the gap between complex datasets and targeted climate strategies.</p>

        <header><h2>The Climate Change Challenge</h2></header>
        <p>As the effects of climate change become increasingly evident, the need for urgent action has pushed environmental sustainability to the forefront of global policy agendas. With the ambitious goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, the UK has been formulating climate mitigation strategies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. However, alongside mitigation, it is crucial to adapt to the physical risks posed by climate change to ensure that vulnerable systems and communities are protected. This dual approach - mitigation and adaptation - is key to achieving the net-zero target while also preserving human health, biodiversity, and economic stability. Despite the commitment, the UK’s Third National Adaptation Programme (NAP3) has faced criticism for failing to keep pace with the urgent need to address the growing physical impacts of climate change. To successfully meet the net-zero target and build resilience, it is imperative for the UK to accelerate its adaptation efforts, enhance cross-sector collaboration, and allocate sufficient resources to address these challenges.
            The purpose of this project is to offer an analytical perspective on the critical trends and implications of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK. By diving deep into long-term emissions data, sectoral contributions, the role of GDP growth, and regional differences, this analysis seeks to uncover the driving forces behind the UK’s carbon footprint. 
            As a public policy student, my hope is that this project will shed light on the trends driving the UK’s emissions and inspire practical policy solutions that help the country achieve its climate goals while building a more sustainable and resilient future.

            <header><h2>Section II: Methodology and Limitations </h2></header>
            <p>The analysis primarily uses government estimates of greenhouse gases published annually by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ). Python was used to scrape some of the data from these sources. After extraction, the data was cleaned, standardized, and merged using Python scripts. Key variables, such as GDP growth per capita and emissions volumes, were standardized to ensure compatibility across datasets. The cleaned data was saved as CSV files locally and then uploaded to GitHub. These files were used to create visualizations with Vega Lite, streamlining the process and ensuring easy access for analysis and visualization tasks. A key limitation of the analysis is the lack of comprehensive data on the impact of carbon taxes on greenhouse gas emissions. Exploring this relationship would provide valuable insights for assessing the effectiveness of carbon taxes in driving emission reductions. Additionally, this project focuses on emissions within the UK, excluding those from imported goods, biomass, and the UK's share of international aviation and shipping.</p>

    <h2>Section III: Data Analysis
    </h2></header></section>
    
        <section>
            <p>The UK tracks greenhouse gas emissions using three main categories: territorial, residence-based (production), and footprint-based (consumption). Territorial emissions measure gases emitted directly within the UK’s borders, such as those from domestic industries, transportation, and energy production. Residence-based emissions consider activities tied to UK residents and businesses, including emissions generated both domestically and abroad. Meanwhile, footprint emissions focus on the environmental impact of goods and services consumed in the UK, regardless of where they are produced. This multi-faceted approach provides a detailed view of the UK's contributions to global emissions and helps inform targeted climate policies. This project focuses on territorial emissions because they provide a direct measure of the greenhouse gases emitted within the UK's borders, offering a clear and consistent basis for tracking progress toward national climate goals. </p>

       <header><h2>Recent Trends in Territorial Emissions
        </h2></header>
        <p>The UK recorded a low of 407 tonnes of territorial greenhouse gas emissions in 2022. This is one of the lowest levels of GHG emissions in the country over the past three decades. The time trend graph shows that the GHG emissions have been falling - total greenhouse gas emissions were 50% lower in 2022 than in 1990. However, the emissions bounced back to 422 tonnes when the economy re-opened post Covid-19 pandemic. </p>

    <section>
        <header><h2>Contribution of Different Greenhouse Gases</h2></header>
        <p>The Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) has been recording the emissions by different types of gases and CO2 has been the biggest contributor with a record high of 342 tonnes in 2022. Rest of the gases including Methane (CH₄), Nitrous Oxide (N₂O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF₆) contribute to a total of 60 tonnes. </p><figure id="Location2"></figure>

    <section>
        <header><h2>Sectoral Breakdown</h2></header>
      <p>A deeper dive into the sectoral breakdown of territorial emissions reveals some striking insights. Transport emerges as the largest contributor to greenhouse gases, with a substantial 111 tonnes in 2023. Trailing behind, but still significant, is the buildings sector, responsible for 77 tonnes of emissions. This highlights the critical role these sectors play in shaping the UK’s overall carbon footprint and underscores the need for targeted policies to curb emissions in these areas. Other major contributors are agriculture, industry, electricity, and fuel supply.

        <header><h2>Pedal Power- Cycling Toward a Greener Future?</h2></header>
    <p>A closer examination of the transport sector reveals several key trends in greenhouse gas emissions over recent decades. Notably, emissions from vans have increased by 40% since 1990, highlighting the growing reliance on light commercial vehicles in the UK. Conversely, emissions from heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) have fallen by 12%, reflecting improvements in fuel efficiency and the adoption of cleaner technologies.However, a significant development is the rising share of emissions from international aviation. As air travel continues to expand, the environmental impact of this sector has come under greater scrutiny. In response, the UK’s 6th Carbon Budget has introduced measures to address these challenges. These include stricter efficiency standards, increased support for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), and investments in low-carbon transport alternatives to ensure alignment with the UK's net-zero emissions target. Walking, cycling, and running are the most eco-friendly transport options, producing zero CO2 emissions. Encouraging cycling to work can help reduce carbon footprints, ease congestion, and promote healthier lifestyles, aligning with the UK's net-zero goals.</p>

        <header> <h2> Mapping the UK’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2></header>
        <p>Greenhouse gas emissions vary significantly across different regions of the UK. The following chart provides a detailed look at per capita emissions and the sectoral contributions to emissions across UK regions. Northern Ireland had the highest per capita emissions at 9.8, followed by Wales and Scotland. Interestingly, England recorded the lowest per capita emissions at 5.1, however, England industries were the largest contributor to the greenhouse gas emissions in the UK.

    <section>
        <header> <h2> Has Uk been able to reduce emissions while achieving economic growth? </h2></header>
        <p>Economic growth is often tied to increased energy use and emissions, especially in energy-intensive sectors. However, the UK shows that growth can align with cutting emissions. Both GDP per capita and CO₂ emissions per capita have fallen, and recent trends suggest emissions will continue to decline.This highlights how clean technology investments can drive both innovation and progress.

    <section>
        <header> <h2> Conclusion </h2></header>
        <p>The analysis reveals that the UK has made great progress in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, but the rebound after the pandemic shows 
            more work is needed, especially in sectors like transportation and buildings. 
            Regional disparities, such as Northern Ireland's high per capita emissions,
             highlight the need for tailored approaches. Economic growth has decoupled from emissions, 
             yet further investment in clean technologies and stricter policies are crucial to achieving the net-zero target by 2050. With a focus on innovation and targeted action, 
             the UK can achieve its climate goals and build a more sustainable, resilient future.</p>
